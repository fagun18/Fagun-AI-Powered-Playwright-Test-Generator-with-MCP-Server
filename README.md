## üîí Security Notice

**Important**: Never commit API keys or secrets to the repository. Always use environment variables or `.env` files for sensitive information.

### Setting up API Keys Securely:
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root
2. Add your API keys as environment variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key_here
   AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_azure_key_here
   ```
3. The `.env` file is automatically ignored by git to prevent accidental commits

## Installation Guide

### Option 1: Local Installation

Read the [quickstart guide](https://docs.browser-use.com/quickstart#prepare-the-environment) or follow the steps below to get started.

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui.git
cd web-ui
```

#### Step 2: Set Up Python Environment
We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for managing the Python environment.

Using uv (recommended):
```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
```

Activate the virtual environment:
- Windows (Command Prompt):
```cmd
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Windows (PowerShell):
```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```
- macOS/Linux:
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

#### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install Python packages:
```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install Browsers in playwright. 
```bash
playwright install --with-deps
```
Or you can install specific browsers by running:
```bash
playwright install chromium --with-deps
```

#### Step 4: Configure Environment
1. Create a copy of the example environment file:
- Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
- macOS/Linux/Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Open `.env` in your preferred text editor and add your API keys and other settings

#### Step 5: Enjoy the web-ui
1.  **Run the WebUI:**
    ```bash
    python Fagun.py --ip 127.0.0.1 --port 7788
    ```
2. **Access the WebUI:** Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:7788`.
3. **Using Your Own Browser(Optional):**
    - Set `BROWSER_PATH` to the executable path of your browser and `BROWSER_USER_DATA` to the user data directory of your browser. Leave `BROWSER_USER_DATA` empty if you want to use local user data.
      - Windows
        ```env
         BROWSER_PATH="C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"
         BROWSER_USER_DATA="C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data"
        ```
        > Note: Replace `YourUsername` with your actual Windows username for Windows systems.
      - Mac
        ```env
         BROWSER_PATH="/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome"
         BROWSER_USER_DATA="/Users/YourUsername/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome"
        ```
    - Close all Chrome windows
    - Open the WebUI in a non-Chrome browser, such as Firefox or Edge. This is important because the persistent browser context will use the Chrome data when running the agent.
    - Check the "Use Own Browser" option within the Browser Settings.

### Option 2: Docker Installation

#### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
  - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) (For Windows/macOS)
  - [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (For Linux)

#### Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/browser-use/web-ui.git
cd web-ui
```

#### Step 2: Configure Environment
1. Create a copy of the example environment file:
- Windows (Command Prompt):
```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
- macOS/Linux/Windows (PowerShell):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
2. Open `.env` in your preferred text editor and add your API keys and other settings

#### Step 3: Docker Build and Run
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
For ARM64 systems (e.g., Apple Silicon Macs), please run follow command:
```bash
TARGETPLATFORM=linux/arm64 docker compose up --build
```

#### Step 4: Enjoy the web-ui and vnc
- Web-UI: Open `http://localhost:7788` in your browser
- VNC Viewer (for watching browser interactions): Open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`
  - Default VNC password: "youvncpassword"
  - Can be changed by setting `VNC_PASSWORD` in your `.env` file
